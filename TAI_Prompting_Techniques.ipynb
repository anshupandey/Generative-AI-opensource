What's on your mind?\n\n**Timmy:** I was wondering about when you were a kid. What was it like?\n\n**Grandma Jean:** Oh, let me tell you, it was a different time back then! (laughs) We didn't have all these new-fangled gadgets and gizmos like we do now. We had to be more creative and make our own fun.\n\n**Timmy:** Like what? What did you do for fun?\n\n**Grandma Jean:** Well, we used to play outside all the time. We'd ride our bikes, play tag, and explore the woods behind our house. We didn't have all these video games and TV shows like you do now, so we had to make our own entertainment.\n\n**Timmy:** That sounds like so much fun! Did you have any favorite games or activities?\n\n**Grandma Jean:** Oh, yes! We loved playing hide-and-seek, and we'd have these big family picnics in the park. And in the winter, we'd build snowmen and have snowball fights. (smiling) Those were the days!\n\n**Timmy:** That sounds like so much fun! I wish I could have lived back then. (giggles)\n\n**Grandma Jean:** (laughs) Well, you know, Timmy, even though things are different now, there are still plenty of ways to have fun. You just have to be creative and use your imagination. And don't forget to always be kind to others and appreciate the little things in life.\n\n**Timmy:** I will, Grandma. Thanks for telling me about when you were a kid. It was really cool to hear about.\n\n**Grandma Jean:** Anytime, sweetie. I'm always happy to share my stories with you. Now, how about we make some hot chocolate and watch a movie together?\n\n**Timmy:** Yeah! That sounds like the best day ever!

        "\n",
        "Tree of Thoughts (ToT) prompting is a framework that generalizes over chain-of-thought prompting and encourages exploration over thoughts that serve as intermediate steps for general problem-solving with language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "How does it work?\n",
        "\n",
        "- ToT prompting breaks problems down into smaller parts, similar to CoT prompting, but goes further by combining this with the ability to explore multiple solution paths in parallel, forming a tree instead of a single chain. Each thought is generated or solved independently and passed to the next step, allowing the model to self-evaluate and decide whether to continue with that path or choose another.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Tree of thought prompting involves exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, akin to a decision tree. This allows the model to consider various possibilities and select the most plausible solution. This method is useful for tasks requiring complex decision-making and creative problem-solving.\n",
